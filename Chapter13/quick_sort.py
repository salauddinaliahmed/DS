"""
Quick Sort:
- Uses a concept called partitioning, which is to take a random value in the array (called the pivot), then we make sure 
  that every number that is less than the pivot ends at the left side of the pivot and 
  every number at that is greater than the pivot is on the right side.

This uses a combination of recursion and looping.
