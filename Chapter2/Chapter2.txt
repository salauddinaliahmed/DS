Chapter 2 Excerise:

1. Steps taken to search number 8 in [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13].
- It would take 4 steps or the index of 8 + 1.

2. Binary search would take
    - Only 1 step. Upper bound is 6, lower bound is 0, so mid point is 3
    - The element, 8 is located at index 3. 

3. The time it would take to perform a binary search on 100000 items.
So, step1 would be 100000/2 = 50000/2 = 25000/2 = 12500/2 = 6750/2 ..
Roughly Log2(n) ~ 16
