Exercise:

1. O(n)
2. O(n+m) -> O(n) 
3. O(N) Wrong O(N*M) This apparently takes O(M*N) since for each needle size we run through the whole haystack
4. This is O(N^3). But could not understand how the inner loops are N/2 and N/4 respectively. It is likely that N/2 and N/4 are taken for simplicity sake. 
But i'd love to understand how the writer reached the N/4 value.
0
5. O(log n)

1 , 2, 3, 4, 5
product so far = 6
len of array = 5

i = 0 
j = 1
k = 2

1, 2, 4 = 8 = product so far.
1, 2, 5 = 10 = product so far.

i = 0
j = 2   
k = 3

1 * 3 * 4 = 12 
1 * 4 * 5 = 20
