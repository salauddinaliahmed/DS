The first chapter of exercises in the DS book. 

1. Array contains 100 elements:
Provide number of steps the following actions will take,

a) Reading - Reading an element takes one(1) step (Technically it finds the starting point and then calculates the index,
                to be read by adding the starting memory location)

b) Searching for a value not contained within the array - 
    - 100 elements, value not contained in the array. We only know this once the entire array is searched.
    So, it takes 100 steps.

c) Insertion at the beginning of the array:
    - First we need to move nth element to the right by 1, then n-1th element to the free nth space and so on
      Until we reach the first space, so thats 100. 
      Then, insert a new value at the beginning, Thus, 100 + 1 = 101

d) Insertion at the end of the array:
    - This operation only takes 1 step (Technically 2 since we need to find the end of the array, which is already stored
        as a size)

e) Deletion at the beginning of the array.
    - First we delete the element. 1 step (99 items remain)
    - Then we move the 99 remaining items 1 step to the left. 
    - Totally, this would take 100 steps.

f) Deletion at the end of the array.
    - This takes only one step. Since we know the size of the array, we just reach the last address and delete it and then 
        update the size.

2. For 100 elements in the array-based SET (Does not allow duplicates).
Provide the number of steps the following operations would take:

a) Reading. - Similar to array 1 step.

b) Searching - Similar to array, needs to search the entire list. 100

c) Insertion - at the beginning, here we search if the value exists. So 100 steps for Searching + 100 steps for moving
    elements to the right and then 1 step to insert.
    200 + 1 = 201

d) Insertion at the end of the set. This would require search - 100 steps and then insertion at the end, so 1 step
    - In total it would need 101 steps.

e) Deletion at the beginning of the set.
    - This is the same as the array. This would take 1 step to delete and 99 steps move everything to the left.
    - Total = 100 steps

f) Deletion at the end of the set.
    - Same as the array, it takes only 1 step. Reach the end and delete the element.

-----------------------------------------

3. If we need to search for all occurences of an element in a array, we would need to search through the entire array and check each element.
    Thus, it would take N steps to search for all occurences of a certain item.
